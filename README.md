This is frontend part of contact-list. It uses Auth0 for authentication and once you sign in
--> You can add new contact
--> You can edit a contact
--> You can delete a contact

Backend is deployed on cyclic.sh. On deployed bon cyclic.sh we get a endpoint. I have mapped that endpoint in frontend to access backend. MongoDB is used as a database in this app.
